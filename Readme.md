# Learning Java

## Java classes and interfaces
- Objects encapsulate data, operations and usage semantics.
- Allow storage and manipulation details to be hidden.
- Separates what is to be done from how it is done
- A class is a template for creating objects
- Classes are made up of state and executable code states are data and executables are methods which manipulate the state of the object.
- Constructors are executable codes that are automatically run when we create an object. Constructor name is same as a class and no return statement.
